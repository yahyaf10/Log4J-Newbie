Level  Description
- OFF	The highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.

- ERROR	Other runtime errors or unexpected conditions. Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.
- WARN	Use of deprecated APIs, poor use of API, 'almost' errors, other runtime situations that are undesirable or unexpected, but not necessarily "wrong". Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.
- INFO	Interesting runtime events (startup/shutdown). Expect these to be immediately visible on a console, so be conservative and keep to a minimum.
